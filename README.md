# Magspoof-49th-SD

This is a modified version of the code from Samy Kamkar's [Magspoof](https://samy.pl/magspoof/) to make it compatible with the Adafruit Trinket so it can be used for a 49th SD building class.  

If you want to modify the code on a Magspoof you made at my class then this is the repo for you.  Download the "Magspoof-49th-SD.ino" file and use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to upload the code to the Trinket.  [This tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/introduction) on the Adafruit Trinked should be used if you have not uploaded code to a Trinket before.
