# Magspoof-49th-SD

This is a modified version of the code from Samy Kamkar's [Magspoof](https://samy.pl/magspoof/) to make it compatible with the Adafruit Trinket so it can be used for a 49th SD building class.  

**If you want to modify the code on a Magspoof you made at my class then this is the repo for you.**  Download the [Magspoof-49th-SD.ino](https://github.com/mtagius/magspoof-49th-SD/blob/master/Magspoof-49th-SD.ino) file and use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to upload the code to the Trinket.  If you have never worked with an Arduino before or if you have never worked with Trinket before I highly recommend [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/introduction).  It is not easy to upload code to a microcontroler if you have never done it before and this long tutorial goes throught just about every step you need to do.  Good luck!  Reach out to me if you need help.
